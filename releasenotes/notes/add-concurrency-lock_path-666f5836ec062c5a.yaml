upgrade:
  - |
    The ``glance::api`` class now supports a ``lock_path`` parameter that
    configures the oslo.concurrency lock_path with a platform specific
    default value. Distributions that are used to defining the lock_path
    with a distribution specific config file may need to override the
    default ``glance::api::lock_path`` value.
fixes:
  - |
    `Bug #1980539 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/puppet-glance/+bug/1980539>`_:
    Configure the oslo.concurrency lock_path, which is now required by cinder
    backends.
